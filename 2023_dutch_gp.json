So I think the Ints is better, but if it's like 2-3 laps, then the Wets maybe. Copy that. It's just because we're thinking about warm-up. So the Ints, I agree, will be better, but we will have a couple of safety car laps, then a couple of warm-up laps, so there won't be very much of racing at full tyre temperature. That's why we are thinking about it.","player_ts":1693147669000},{"driver_number":40,"Driver":"LAW","transcription":"Liam, can you hear me? Yeah, copy. Okay, mate. So, most likely, the FIA will tell us which tyre to use, either Inter or Xtreme. But if they don't, and if we have a choice, so the Xtreme could be good very initially for the restart, but then the Gag will be higher than the Inter. So, we have seven laps remaining. We're lucky to have a couple of safety car laps. So, basically, we'll probably have four or five rest laps remaining. So, have a think. If you would like to try something, if you have a view, have a think if you have a view. Otherwise, we decide for you.","player_ts":1693147626000},{"driver_number":20,"Driver":"MAG","transcription":"Yeah, the rain should stop in about 7 minutes, but there is further rain away.

So, the inters that are on the car look to be as good as anything else we've got. We haven't got any new ones left.

Yeah, the rain...","player_ts":1693147602000},{"driver_number":23,"Driver":"ALB","transcription":"I'll get out. Yeah, if you're happy, we'll stay. We'll put an umbrella over you.

And we will restart going out of the pitlane in the position you are now. And likely there will be a couple of safety car laps, likely some safety car laps before we go racing again. Copy, copy. You just tell me what I can do for temperature and then... Yeah, so we are doing a step for the tyres. We are doing a step for the tyres. We are also doing a step for the brakes.

Can you focus into what you want to do? Think about that formation lap. Getting the tyres, rear tyre warm-up would be crucial for the start. That's what we discussed about the brakes. Pushing the high speed on that formation lap. And after the start, whatever happens, just do what you can do. Don't try to do too much. We'll be there with you. The first few corners are quite important. We talked about it. EOP10, have a good one. Enjoy mate.","player_ts":1693140871000},{"driver_number":11,"Driver":"PER","transcription":"So, four log-bound Ls from this line.","player_ts":1693140908000},{"driver_number":24,"Driver":"ZHO","transcription":"I'll probably go 7.8 then, just to be sure.

That cell that I said could be hitting in around 10 laps into the race that look quite short and sharp. That is maybe breaking up a little bit or at least reducing in intensity. So I'll keep you updated over the first 4-5 laps of the race. May well be something we can drive through at this stage now. Whereas the board is looking like it. We're looking at a requirement for a switch to Itters.","player_ts":1693140872000},{"driver_number":81,"Driver":"PIA","transcription":"Oscar, radio and drink check.

Six minutes till we go. So weather-wise, there is rain building. Sometimes it disappears. So we're kind of prepared for that with our tyre choice. Okay, and then we went through all the data and what is happening with our tyres. We've reverted the laps to grid adjust. It was just too much, it took out too much front. And then we've corrected for the tyre compound for the race start. So we basically used the first lap. First lap aero balance and then just corrected for delta. For tyre.","player_ts":1693140850000},{"driver_number":14,"Driver":"ALO","transcription":"Okay, I'll give it to you, good.
